#Curtis Henderson - Portfolio Site

##Task -
I was tasked with creating my first portfolio site using html and css knowledge I've received over the last few weeks in the course. I has special requirements to fulfil before I could submit the project. 

##Planning Stage -
After reading over the instructions and requirments for the project I began where all good developers do, in the planning phase. I sketched out my site with the details and elements I would like to have on it and began to create the skeleton of my site. I knew I wanted the grid to contain my name so I made an additional sketch of a CSS grid and how I wanted the tiles to appear once it was rendered.

##Action Steps -
I took my sketches and skeleton and began to build from there. I would frequently check on my site as I added html elements and eventually the css elements. I went with a top down approach and began with an enticing header image and continued to the about, works/portfolio, and contact sections respectively. If I came across any road blocks, I used my online resources to figure out the problem. Luckily I didn't come across anything that was out of my wheelhouse and finished the desktop site first.

After some time, I started to add css rules to adapt the page to a mobile phone. I was really happy with how the layout rendered in a mobile setting as well and I began to add and commit the final files into my repo.

After initializing the repo, I reviewed my site on my laptop and on my phone. They both were to my liking so I began any final revisions and markups.

#Review and Conclusion
This project was a fun one. I was excited to see that the information I've been learning these past few weeks could allow me to create something totally unique to me. I know that I have a lot more to learn, but I'm looking forward to the challenges that lie ahead with this bootcamp.
